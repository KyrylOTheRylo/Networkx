# Networkx
From inputfile (txt file with edges)

1 Task:
distribution of given adjacency list of edges written in a data file
with built-in networkx methods

2 Task:
Creating an own nodes distribution 

3 - 4 Task:
Finding components of the Graph
for each component finding amount of nodes and edges, radius, diameter 
for each node finding degree of that and eccentricity
    
then highlighting random way(path) with length equals to diameter of each component
and showing it up 

5 Task:
finding a DFS tree by using built-in methods of the "networkx" library  and highlighting edges with a function 
"new_edges" then showing received picture
